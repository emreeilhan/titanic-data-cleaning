# Titanic Data Cleaning Project 🚢

A complete data cleaning and preprocessing project using the Titanic dataset from [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/titanic/data).

---

## 🔍 Project Goals

This project focuses on preparing the Titanic dataset for machine learning.  
We aim to clean, transform, and engineer features using best practices.

---

## ✅ Steps Completed

- [x] Missing value handling (`Age`, `Cabin`, `Embarked`)
- [x] Outlier detection and treatment
- [x] Feature extraction (e.g. extracting titles from names)
- [x] Encoding categorical variables (`Sex`, `Embarked`)
- [x] Feature scaling (Standardization and Normalization)

---

## 📊 Libraries Used

- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `sklearn`
